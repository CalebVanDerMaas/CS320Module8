How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Testing the code is essential for making sure that your program works the way that you want it to without creating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by bad actors. Testing allows us to run our code in an environment that is encapsulated and private while still experiencing the same result that the end user will see.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
 User needs should be the backbone of a program and its functionality. This should be the basis that the program is built off of. It should also be the last check that makes sure the application is working properly. The best way to do this at the end of the programming life cycle is through testing. Testing allows us to directly create criteron based on user needs and make sure that they were correctly implemented into the application the way they should be.
How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design with the end user in mind at all times. A lot of people can get hung up on how their applcation looks or feels, but missing the mark for how an application is supposed to work is a crucial mistake that no professional programmer should want to make. This means that the end user should be at the forefront of every decision from designing to creating to testing. This will ensure that in the end, the best product is created for the user including not only how it looks and feels but also how it functions.
